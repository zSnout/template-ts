# zSnout's TypeScript Template

This is a template for TypeScript projects created on zSnout. It has automatic
Dependabot updates, a GNU GPL-3 license, and a reasonable `tsconfig.json`. Some
of the configuration for this project is zSnout specific. If you're using this
personally, edit the CONTRIBUTING.md and FUNDING.yml files.
